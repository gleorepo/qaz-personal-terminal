# QAZ Model 100
#Keyboards

The QAZ Model 100 is a cyberdeck inspired by the TRS/Tandy Model 100 portable computer from the mid 1980s. The Model 100 was a valuable productivity tool for writers on-the-go, especially reporters. It had an excellent  (for a portable computer) keyboard, useful software, and suitable screenâ€” all in a small footprint. 

The QAZ Model 100 follows the TRS 100 in being keyboard-focused, but substitutes out the antiquated 75% keyboard for a  layout known as QAZ.  using 34/37 keys, QAZ is a layout that is more suitable for the 21st century. It ditches single-purpose keys for key chords and layers that eliminates wild hand acrobatics while increasing input speed. 

The QAZ model 100 pairs this keyboard with a perfectly-matched and gorgeous 7.9 inch screen from Waveshare. The brains are provided by a Banana Pi M2, and the whole system is powered by an Ampripper 3000 power supply.

All of this is packed into case that is 20mm thick and no wider than a sheet of letter-size paper.

## Instructions
This build proceeds in 4 steps.

1. Print the case.
2. Make the keyboard.
3. Make the usb cables.
4. Connect it up!

The most difficult part of this build is making the usb cables. This does not require special soldering skills, but you should be comfortable soldering. A *third hand* is highly recommended. 

### Keyboard Build

The QAZ build is no different than building a QAZ as a normal keyboard. So, you can follow the steps available here:

### The USB Cables

You need to make 3 cables. The first is a usb micro to usb micro OTG cable that connects the keyboard to the Banana Pi. The second is a usb c to usb micro power-only cable that connects the Banana Pi to the Ampripper 3000 usb c output. The third is a half cable with two bare wires on one end and a usb micro on the other to connect the 5v and Ground pads of the amp ripper to the usb micro in port of the screen.
